      <description>My PC just passed away. My good old one since 2009… so I decided to buy a desktop computer running OSX 10.10 (although I cannot exclude the possibility of partitioning the disk and installing also Linux…). For now, I missed some apps, which I installed with Fink (a popular debian-based distro ported to Mac).
One of the programs I was fiddling around with was BayesX: “Bayesian Inference in Structured Additive Regression Models”, authored by great people at Muenchen University, (specially Nadja and Thomas, whom I’m glad to know personally).</description>

      <title>An .EPS to .PDF converter (using LaTeX!)</title>

      <description>I am about to go on a short holiday, so I was tidying the code lines I had scattered around before leaving… And I found this: a minimal EPS to PDF converter, which is barely a LaTeX template.
It is intended for transforming an .EPS graph to the .PDF format. You can copy &amp;amp; paste this whole code into a blank text file (but with .TEX extension) and run it with a TeX editor.</description>
