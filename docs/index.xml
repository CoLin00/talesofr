   These days, between the 19th and 21st of February, has taken place the learning activity titled ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Survival Data, with Applications in R‚Äù organized by the Interdisciplinary Group of Biostatistics (ICBUSC), directed by Professor Carmen Cadarso-Su√°rez, from the University of Santiago de Compostela.
 The international nature of this scientific activity has been marked by the presence of researchers from different European countries such as Germany, Portugal, Holland, Greece or Turkey.</description>

      <description>Introduction  The last two days arrived at my twitter feed some discussions on how bad are the following sentences at the beginning of your R script/notebook, sparked by @JennyBryan‚Äôs slides at the IASC-ARS/NZSA Conference:
 setwd()
 and
 rm(list = ls())
 
 The only two things that make @JennyBryan üò§üò†ü§Ø. Instead use projects + here::here() #rstats pic.twitter.com/GwxnHePL4n
&amp;mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) December 11, 2017  Blog post elaborating on my advice to avoid setwd() and rm(list = ls()) at top of an #rstats script.</description>

      <description>Introduction  There are several ways to mine tables and other content from a pdf, using R. After a lot of trial &amp;amp; error, here‚Äôs how I managed to extract global exam results from an international, massive, yearly examination, the EDAIC.
This is my first use case of ‚Äúpdf mining‚Äù with R, and also a fairly simple one. However, more complex and very fine examples of this can be found elsewhere, using both pdftools and tabulizer packages.</description>

      <title>Tracking Septic Patients in a Hospital</title>

      <description>Background A hospital may be defined as a place, or building, or set of facilities where patients go to receive the care they need.
In ancient times, a hospital was not much more than a hotel for the poor, where they could stay and be cared for. Some centuries passed, and now we call hospitals to extremely complex structures, from both physical and functional perspectives.
In this context, patients usually undergo a wide variety of diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures.</description>

      <description>The blogdown R package  Finally, -after 24h of failed attempts-, I could get my favourite Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
 After exploring some alternatives, like Shirin‚Äôs (with Jekyll), and Amber Thomas advice (which involved Git skills beyond my basic abilities), I was able to install Yihui‚Äôs hugo-lithium-theme in a new repository.
However, I wanted to explore other blog templates, hosted in GiHub, like:</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION CONFIGURING TEXWORKS In MS Windows In (K)Ubuntu &amp;amp; MacOSX  WRITING A .RNW FILE EDIT FOR TEXWORKS IN UBUNTU   INTRODUCTION Sweave is nothing more, nothing less than one of the best ways R can connect with a text editor, in this case LaTeX.
So you don‚Äôt know anyting about LaTeX? neither did I 8 months ago‚Ä¶ The hyperlinks in this post will take you to some great pages, to learn different things in an organised way.</description>

      <description>These days I was remembering my beginnings as a linux user few years ago, and how I found R (possibly in a very unlikely way: searching for a SPSS alternative in Linux). For two years, R had been almost impossible for me. I didn‚Äôt understand its syntax (I don‚Äôt have programming background), and luckily I had installed R Commander (Rcmdr) to perform simple analysis and plots‚Ä¶
Another feature of Rcmdr (that I didn‚Äôt use) was that every click to a button remains in a part of Rcmdr‚Äôs console, and then it can be copied, used and modified.</description>

      <description>Reinhart, Rogoff‚Ä¶ and R EDIT: At the time I wrote this post, I didn‚Äôt know of the existence of this great one, from Christopher Gandrud, take a look!
On april, the 15th, an article was published that will change economic theories‚Ä¶ Or at least, it will questionate and change the methods employed to formule those theories. As a doctor, I spend time on reviewing evidence that can be applied to daily practice.</description>

      <description>R has been recognised as the most powerful statistical tool for displaying graphs. In the last years, R‚Äôs awesomeness in depicting relationships between variables is exploding with great packages such as ggplot2. One can simply walk around some R blogs, and find something like this:
The ‚Äòwatercolor‚Äô plot (aka √† la Solomon Hsiang).
Once you click these links above, you will forget completely about my blog, so‚Ä¶ wait! I have to show a graph I made with the code provided there!</description>
