      <description>My PC just passed away. My good old one since 2009… so I decided to buy a desktop computer running OSX 10.10 (although I cannot exclude the possibility of partitioning the disk and installing also Linux…). For now, I missed some apps, which I installed with Fink (a popular debian-based distro ported to Mac).
One of the programs I was fiddling around with was BayesX: “Bayesian Inference in Structured Additive Regression Models”, authored by great people at Muenchen University, (specially Nadja and Thomas, whom I’m glad to know personally).</description>
