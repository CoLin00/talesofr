      <description>My PC just passed away. My good old one since 2009… so I decided to buy a desktop computer running OSX 10.10 (although I cannot exclude the possibility of partitioning the disk and installing also Linux…). For now, I missed some apps, which I installed with Fink (a popular debian-based distro ported to Mac).
One of the programs I was fiddling around with was BayesX: “Bayesian Inference in Structured Additive Regression Models”, authored by great people at Muenchen University, (specially Nadja and Thomas, whom I’m glad to know personally).</description>

      <description>Playing with my tablet some time ago, I wondered if installing R could be possible. You know, a small android device “to the power of R”…
After searching on Google from time to time, I came across some interesting possibilities:
 R Instructor, created “to bridge the gap between authoritative (but expensive) reference textbooks and free but often technical and difficult to understand help files”.
 R Console Free. provides the necessary C, C++ and Fortran compilers to build and install R packages.</description>
