      <description>Playing with my tablet some time ago, I wondered if installing R could be possible. You know, a small android device “to the power of R”…
After searching on Google from time to time, I came across some interesting possibilities:
 R Instructor, created “to bridge the gap between authoritative (but expensive) reference textbooks and free but often technical and difficult to understand help files”.
 R Console Free. provides the necessary C, C++ and Fortran compilers to build and install R packages.</description>

      <description>These days I was remembering my beginnings as a linux user few years ago, and how I found R (possibly in a very unlikely way: searching for a SPSS alternative in Linux). For two years, R had been almost impossible for me. I didn’t understand its syntax (I don’t have programming background), and luckily I had installed R Commander (Rcmdr) to perform simple analysis and plots…
Another feature of Rcmdr (that I didn’t use) was that every click to a button remains in a part of Rcmdr’s console, and then it can be copied, used and modified.</description>
