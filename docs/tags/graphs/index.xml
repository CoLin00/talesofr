      <description>I like heatplots with p-values -or frequencies, or whatever-. Not very conclusive, but pretty anyway. And when talking about graphs, pretty will make our neurons to fire in more interesting ways: neurons like “pretty” graphs. Moreover, observing your data can be as important as analysing it. It’s better to observe, to listen your patients than making tests without knowing very much about them…
In the heatmaps of the previous post, not a lot of information can be included.</description>

      <description>R has been recognised as the most powerful statistical tool for displaying graphs. In the last years, R’s awesomeness in depicting relationships between variables is exploding with great packages such as ggplot2. One can simply walk around some R blogs, and find something like this:
The ‘watercolor’ plot (aka à la Solomon Hsiang).
Once you click these links above, you will forget completely about my blog, so… wait! I have to show a graph I made with the code provided there!</description>
