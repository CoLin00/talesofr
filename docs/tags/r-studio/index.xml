      <description>Some time ago, since I was able to use R by myself, have found some fellows and other people who wanted to learn R as well. Then I pointed them to help pages, to CRAN repositories‚Ä¶ but in some cases they said that didn‚Äôt know how to start using those resources. Obviously, the main self-perceived limitation for non-programmers is the use of ‚Äúcommands‚Äù -ok, many of the 80‚Äôs kids will remember the use of some command lines to access games such as PacMan, Frogger‚Ä¶ üôÇ</description>

      <title>Power and sample size calculator for mitochondrial DNA association studies (Shiny)</title>

      <description>The functions detailed inside the piece of code below (in a Gist) has been useful for me when I had to calculate many possible scenarios of statistical power and sample size. The formulae were taken from the article of Samuels et al., AJHG 2006, and the script showed even useful for making a variety of comparative plots.
This is intended for estimating power/ sample size in association studies, involving mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (which are categories whose frequencies depend on each other), on a Chi-square test basis.</description>
