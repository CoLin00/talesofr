   These days, between the 19th and 21st of February, has taken place the learning activity titled ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Survival Data, with Applications in R‚Äù organized by the Interdisciplinary Group of Biostatistics (ICBUSC), directed by Professor Carmen Cadarso-Su√°rez, from the University of Santiago de Compostela.
 The international nature of this scientific activity has been marked by the presence of researchers from different European countries such as Germany, Portugal, Holland, Greece or Turkey.</description>

      <description>Introduction  The last two days arrived at my twitter feed some discussions on how bad are the following sentences at the beginning of your R script/notebook, sparked by @JennyBryan‚Äôs slides at the IASC-ARS/NZSA Conference:
 setwd()
 and
 rm(list = ls())
 
 The only two things that make @JennyBryan üò§üò†ü§Ø. Instead use projects + here::here() #rstats pic.twitter.com/GwxnHePL4n
&amp;mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) December 11, 2017  Blog post elaborating on my advice to avoid setwd() and rm(list = ls()) at top of an #rstats script.</description>

      <description>Introduction  There are several ways to mine tables and other content from a pdf, using R. After a lot of trial &amp;amp; error, here‚Äôs how I managed to extract global exam results from an international, massive, yearly examination, the EDAIC.
This is my first use case of ‚Äúpdf mining‚Äù with R, and also a fairly simple one. However, more complex and very fine examples of this can be found elsewhere, using both pdftools and tabulizer packages.</description>

      <title>Tracking Septic Patients in a Hospital</title>

      <description>Background A hospital may be defined as a place, or building, or set of facilities where patients go to receive the care they need.
In ancient times, a hospital was not much more than a hotel for the poor, where they could stay and be cared for. Some centuries passed, and now we call hospitals to extremely complex structures, from both physical and functional perspectives.
In this context, patients usually undergo a wide variety of diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures.</description>

      <description>The blogdown R package  Finally, -after 24h of failed attempts-, I could get my favourite Hugo theme up and running with R Studio and Blogdown.
 After exploring some alternatives, like Shirin‚Äôs (with Jekyll), and Amber Thomas advice (which involved Git skills beyond my basic abilities), I was able to install Yihui‚Äôs hugo-lithium-theme in a new repository.
However, I wanted to explore other blog templates, hosted in GiHub, like:</description>

      <title>Power and sample size calculator for mitochondrial DNA association studies (Shiny)</title>
      <link>/2013/07/power-sample-size-mitochondrial-dna/</link>

      <guid>/2013/07/power-sample-size-mitochondrial-dna/</guid>
      <description>The functions detailed inside the piece of code below (in a Gist) has been useful for me when I had to calculate many possible scenarios of statistical power and sample size. The formulae were taken from the article of Samuels et al., AJHG 2006, and the script showed even useful for making a variety of comparative plots.
This is intended for estimating power/ sample size in association studies, involving mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (which are categories whose frequencies depend on each other), on a Chi-square test basis.</description>

      <description>I use both GNU-Linux and Windows systems on a regular basis‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm aware of the advantages (more for GNU-Linux in my case) and disadvantages of both.
Recently I needed to analyse a database from a remote location, an Excel (`*xlsx) file.
The problem was that I couldn‚Äôt put my gdata library to work‚Ä¶ some weird errors about a missing Perl interpreter‚Ä¶ just needed to install one. Based on this tutorial in CRAN, I downloaded ActivePerl.</description>

      <title>heatmaps with p-values (2)... coloured according to odds ratio</title>
      <link>/2013/05/heatmaps-p-values-coloured-by-odds-ratio/</link>

      <guid>/2013/05/heatmaps-p-values-coloured-by-odds-ratio/</guid>
      <description>I like heatplots with p-values -or frequencies, or whatever-. Not very conclusive, but pretty anyway. And when talking about graphs, pretty will make our neurons to fire in more interesting ways: neurons like ‚Äúpretty‚Äù graphs. Moreover, observing your data can be as important as analysing it. It‚Äôs better to observe, to listen your patients than making tests without knowing very much about them‚Ä¶
In the heatmaps of the previous post, not a lot of information can be included.</description>

      <title>... ridiculously photogenic factors (heatmap with p-values)</title>
      <link>/2013/05/ridiculously-photogenic-heatmap-p-values/</link>

      <guid>/2013/05/ridiculously-photogenic-heatmap-p-values/</guid>
      <description>Some months ago, I had to explore a vast amount of categorical variables before making some multivariate analyses.
One good way to know your raw data, to make new hypotheses‚Ä¶etc, is to calculate some pairwise ‚Äúcrude‚Äù chi-square tests of independence of your factors, but it can be very time-consuming.
I mean, not time-consuming to make the tests (with a simple command it can be done), but to revise all of them.</description>

      <title>...learning LaTeX, from scratch!</title>
      <link>/2013/05/learning-latex-from-scratch/</link>

      <description>‚ÄúLaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation, and is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents.‚Äù
 
It is also‚Ä¶ Free and Open. Specially designed for beautiful documents even when they include special language: mathematic formulae, phonetic symbols, musical notation‚Ä¶
The mix of normal text with special languages is indeed much better arranged in LaTeX than in any other text editor, so maybe it can be interesting for you!</description>
