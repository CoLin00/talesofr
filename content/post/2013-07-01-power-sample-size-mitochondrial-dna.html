<p>The functions detailed inside the piece of code below (in a Gist) has been useful for me when I had to calculate many possible scenarios of statistical power and sample size. The formulae were taken from the article of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1424681/" target="_blank">Samuels et al., AJHG 2006</a>, and the script showed even useful for making a variety of comparative plots.</p>
<p>This is intended for estimating power/ sample size in association studies, involving mitochondrial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroup" target="_blank">DNA haplogroups</a> (which are categories whose frequencies depend on each other), on a Chi-square test basis. The problem with scripts is that sometimes they aren’t as friendly to many people as GUIs are. To solve this, there are many solutions but, as I don’t have programming background (apart from R), the most straightforward for me was <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/" target="_blank">Shiny</a>.</p>
<p>Shiny is a friendly interface which allows for great interactive features (see its <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial/#welcome" target="_blank">Tutorial</a>), and it loads onto the web browser from an open R console, just by clicking:</p>
<p><a href="https://aurora.shinyapps.io/mtDNA_power_calc/" target="_blank"><code>https://aurora.shinyapps.io/mtDNA_power_calc/</code></a></p>
<p>This Gist, displays a simple graph using two power/number-of-cases values (it was hard for me to show the graph, mostly thanks to Stackoverflow and to MadScone):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(shiny)
shiny::runGist(&#39;5895082&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Where 5895082 is the ID of the Gist. Here is the source:</p>
{{< gist aurora-mareviv 5895082>}}
<p>To work with files inside your computer, just run R from the same directory of the files ui.R and server.R, and execute the Gist with the command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>runApp()</code></pre>
<p>If this doesn’t work, you can paste the complete path to the ui and server files:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>runApp(&quot;path/to/directory&quot;)</code></pre>
