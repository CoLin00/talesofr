<p>I am about to go on a short holiday, so I was tidying the code lines I had scattered around before leaving… And I found this: a minimal EPS to PDF converter, which is barely a LaTeX template.</p>
<p>It is intended for transforming an .EPS graph to the .PDF format. You can copy &amp; paste this whole code into a blank text file (but with .TEX extension) and run it with a TeX editor. To install and use LaTeX, here it is a <a href="https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2013/05/learning-latex-from-scratch/" target="_blank">previous post</a> about it.</p>
<p>When you have compiled it, you can search in the same file’s directory for the newly created PDF graph!</p>
