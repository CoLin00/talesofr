The functions detailed inside the piece of code below (in a Gist) has been useful for me when I had to calculate many possible scenarios of statistical power and sample size. The formulae were taken from the article of [Samuels et al., AJHG 2006](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1424681/){target="_blank"}, and the script showed even useful for making a variety of comparative plots.

This is intended for estimating power/ sample size in association studies, involving mitochondrial [DNA haplogroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroup){target="_blank"} (which are categories whose frequencies depend on each other), on a Chi-square test basis. The problem with scripts is that sometimes they aren't as friendly to many people as GUIs are. To solve this, there are many solutions but, as I don't have programming background (apart from R), the most straightforward for me was [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/){target="_blank"}.

Shiny is a friendly interface which allows for great interactive features (see its [Tutorial](http://rstudio.github.io/shiny/tutorial/#welcome){target="_blank"}), and it loads onto the web browser from an open R console, just by clicking:

[`https://aurora.shinyapps.io/mtDNA_power_calc/`](https://aurora.shinyapps.io/mtDNA_power_calc/){target="_blank"}

This Gist, displays a simple graph using two power/number-of-cases values (it was hard for me to show the graph, mostly thanks to Stackoverflow and to MadScone):

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shiny::runGist('5895082')
```

Where 5895082 is the ID of the Gist. Here is the source:

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< gist aurora-mareviv 5895082>}}")`

To work with files inside your computer, just run R from the same directory of the files ui.R and server.R, and execute the Gist with the command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
runApp()
```

If this doesn't work, you can paste the complete path to the ui and server files:

```{r eval=FALSE}
runApp("path/to/directory")
```
