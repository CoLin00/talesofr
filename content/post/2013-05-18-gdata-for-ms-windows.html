<p>I use both GNU-Linux and Windows systems on a regular basis… so I’m aware of the advantages (more for GNU-Linux in my case) and disadvantages of both.</p>
<p>Recently I needed to analyse a database from a remote location, an Excel (`*xlsx) file.</p>
<p>The problem was that I couldn’t put my gdata library to work… some weird errors about a missing Perl interpreter… just needed to install one. Based on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gdata/INSTALL" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> in CRAN, I downloaded <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads" target="_blank">ActivePerl</a>.</p>
<p>Then, I followed the instructions to install it, leaving the default options. The program sets the PATH to the interpreter, so R can finally find Perl…</p>
<p>Just start then a R session… Done!</p>
