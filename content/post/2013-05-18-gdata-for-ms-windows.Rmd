I use both GNU-Linux and Windows systems on a regular basis... so I'm aware of the advantages (more for GNU-Linux in my case) and disadvantages of both.

Recently I needed to analyse a database from a remote location, an Excel (`*xlsx) file.

The problem was that I couldn't put my gdata library to work... some weird errors about a missing Perl interpreter... just needed to install one. Based on [this tutorial](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gdata/INSTALL){target="_blank"} in CRAN, I downloaded [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads){target="_blank"}.

Then, I followed the instructions to install it, leaving the default options. The program sets the PATH to the interpreter, so R can finally find Perl...

Just start then a R session... Done!
