The [R-Spain Conferences](http://r-es.org/VI+Jornadas){target="_blank"} have been taking place since 2009 as an expression of the growing interest that R elicits in many fileds. The organisers are the [Comunidad R Hispano](http://r-es.org/Comunidad){target="_blank"} (R-es). The community supports many groups and initiatives aimed to develop R knowledge and widen its use.

To attend the talks by [streaming](http://r-es.org/Asistencia+remota+a+las+VI+Jornadas){target="_blank"} (they are in Spanish) you must [registrate](http://r-es.org/tiki-register.php){target="_blank"}.

There is also a [scientific programme](http://r-es.org/Programa+de+las+VI+Jornadas){target="_blank"} with the presentations (some in English) here.
