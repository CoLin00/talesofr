<p>Some time ago, since I was able to use R by myself, have found some fellows and other people who wanted to learn R as well. Then I pointed them to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html" target="_blank">help pages</a>, to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">CRAN</a> repositories‚Ä¶ but in some cases they said that didn‚Äôt know how to start using those resources. Obviously, the main self-perceived limitation for non-programmers is the use of ‚Äúcommands‚Äù -ok, many of the 80‚Äôs kids will remember the use of some command lines to access games such as PacMan, Frogger‚Ä¶ üôÇ</p>
<p>At the same time, they also wanted to refresh some basic statistics, acquiring a general knowledge of their data before asking for a statistician‚Äôs help. An idea to quickly help them was to make some scripts to guide them through basic commands, seeing results on real-time, and being able to recycle them for their own data.</p>
<p>If you have just started using R, maybe they can be useful for you. However, I will recommend that you use some open ‚Äúplain text‚Äù file(s) to paste your favorite commands and clone/modify them to suit your needs. Remember to store the files where you can access them later!</p>

<p>Tip: you can <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions#show-hide-file-name-extensions=windows-vista" target="_blank">change the extension</a> of your <span class="texttt">‚Äúmytext.txt‚Äù </span> file into mytext.R file, telling Windows to open it with the Notepad again. It will be also a plain text document, but some text editors will recognize it as an ‚ÄúR script‚Äù and will highlight the content according to that.</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Apart from the Notepad in Windows, you also have a bunch of other text/code editors which are more pleasant to use. See for example <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop" target="_blank">R-Studio</a> and <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad ++</a>.</p>

<p>Copy the Gists below into your own text files, and begin playing with R!</p>
