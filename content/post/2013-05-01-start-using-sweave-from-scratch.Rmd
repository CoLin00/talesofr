## INTRODUCTION

[Sweave](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com.es/2010/02/getting-started-with-sweave-r-latex.html) is nothing more, nothing less than one of the best ways R can connect with a text editor, in this case [LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Introduction). 

So you don't know anyting about LaTeX? neither did I 8 months ago... The hyperlinks in this post will take you to some great pages, to learn different things in an organised way. Here's how I did it (with lots of help from google though!).

It's important to take it step by step...  

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< youtube QHH3iSeDBLo>}}")`  

<br> 

Second, you need to install R, from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/). Once you have installed it, you will need to install a LaTeX distribution (my preferred LaTeX editor is TeXworks, and I have MiKTeX in MS Windows).

- If you are a MS Windows user, you will find useful this one: [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). 

- For Linux users, here can be [Kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/) (from KDE), [TeXworks](http://www.tug.org/texworks/), or other alternatives. First of all you should install LaTeX (e.g. TeX Live), and configure it with these [tips](https://dzone.com/articles/installing-latex-ubuntu)

- For Mac users, you can follow this [link (valid for other OSes)](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) which provides instructions to install TeXmaker. You will be able to install TeXworks from [here](http://www.tug.org/texworks/).

- **NOTE**: Both, MiKTeX and TeXmaker have portable versions, easy to carry in a pendrive!  

What TeX editor did you install? If you have TeXworks, the way to configure Sweave is pretty quick and easy. If you are a beginner, this may be the best option.

## CONFIGURING TEXWORKS

If you have TeXworks, all you have to do is go to:

`Edit >> Preferences >> Typesetting`

### In MS Windows

You will see this screen:

![MS-Windows](/images/sweave/texworkssweave-1.png)

If you click the "`+`" button (highlighted in green) to add a new tool, another screen will appear:

![MS-Windows](/images/sweave/windows-texworkssweave.png)

You only have to fill in these fields with the name of the new tool, `Sweave` and adding its "arguments" clicking in the "`+`" sign.

The field `Program` is filled with the path to your R executable, which can be similar to that in the picture. Just be careful to type "slashes" ( `/` ) instead of "backslashes" ( `\` ).

The field `Arguments` will contain all the commands that Sweave needs to connect to the R console, to interpret R's code and to produce a .TEX file and a .PDF.

### In (K)Ubuntu & MacOSX

In (K)Ubuntu is configured in a similar way:

![Kubuntu](/images/sweave/kubuntu-texworkssweave.png)

And so in Mac OS X (note that we have the same Sweave commands as in Ubuntu):

![MacOSX](/images/sweave/macosx-texworkssweave.png)


## WRITING A .RNW FILE

Let's write something in a new Sweave file!. To this, you must create a new text file (e.g. `myfirstsweave.txt`) , and change its extension to `.Rnw` (see [this](https://support.microsoft.com/es-es/products/windows?os=windows-10) for more help for MSWin users):

 `myfirstsweave.Rnw`

This is a blank file, but you can paste the following [code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082429/plot-a-heart-in-r) to construct a template:

`r htmltools::HTML("{{< gist aurora-mareviv 30cb0fd72f1d1a233af0e4d3fc304907>}}")`


Once you have your template, you must... "compile" it. First, you can highlight the code with nice colours clicking:

`Format >> Syntax Coloring >> LaTeX`

To compile the LaTeX/Sweave file, you have to click in the pull-down menu, and select:

`Sweave`

![MacTeX](/images/sweave/sweave_compilation.png)

Great! the last step is to click in the green, round "play" button...

Voilà!

## EDIT FOR TEXWORKS IN UBUNTU

The installation of TeXworks in my Kubuntu 12.04 has been direct from the console -at least it worked for me-, without following further instructions:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install texworks
```

After the configuration of Sweave typesetting -see above-, I was trying to compile my own template, and this error appeared:

<div class="well well-sm">

>`Error in texi2dvi(file = file, pdf = TRUE, clean = clean, quiet = quiet, :`  
`Running 'texi2dvi' on 'untitled-1.tex' failed.`  
`Messages:`  
`sh: 1: /usr/bin/texi2dvi: not found`  

</div>  
<br>

`Texi2dvi` appears to be a script that allows direct compilation of a `.pdf` from a `.Rnw` file.


Maybe it's not the cleanest solution, but I copied the [source code of `texi2dvi`](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texi2dvi) and created a script with it: (`sudo gedit` if you are running Ubuntu, `sudo kate` if Kubuntu)

Open up a Terminal and type:


```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo kate /usr/bin/texi2dvi
```


Then you can paste the code into this script, and save the changes. To **make it executable**, type in the Terminal:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/texi2dvi
```
