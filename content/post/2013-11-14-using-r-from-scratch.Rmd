Some time ago, since I was able to use R by myself, have found some fellows and other people who wanted to learn R as well. Then I pointed them to [help pages](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html){target="_blank"}, to [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} repositories... but in some cases they said that didn't know how to start using those resources. Obviously, the main self-perceived limitation for non-programmers is the use of "commands" -ok, many of the 80's kids will remember the use of some command lines to access games such as PacMan, Frogger... ðŸ™‚

At the same time, they also wanted to refresh some basic statistics, acquiring a general knowledge of their data before asking for a statistician's help. An idea to quickly help them was to make some scripts to guide them through basic commands, seeing results on real-time, and being able to recycle them for their own data.

If you have just started using R, maybe they can be useful for you. However, I will recommend that you use some open "plain text" file(s) to paste your favorite commands and clone/modify them to suit your needs. Remember to store the files where you can access them later!

<div class="alert alert-success"> 
Tip: you can [change the extension](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions#show-hide-file-name-extensions=windows-vista){target="_blank"} of your <span class="texttt">"mytext.txt" </span> file into mytext.R file, telling Windows to open it with the Notepad again. It will be also a plain text document, but some text editors will recognize it as an "R script" and will highlight the content according to that.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Apart from the Notepad in Windows, you also have a bunch of other text/code editors which are more pleasant to use. See for example [R-Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop){target="_blank"} and [Notepad ++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/){target="_blank"}.

Copy the Gists below into your own text files, and begin playing with R!
