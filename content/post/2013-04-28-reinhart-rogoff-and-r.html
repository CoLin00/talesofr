<h1>Reinhart, Rogoff… and R</h1>
<p>EDIT: At the time I wrote this post, I didn’t know of the existence of <a title="http://www.r-bloggers.com/reinhart-rogoff-everyone-makes-coding-mistakes-we-need-to-make-it-easy-to-find-them-graphing-uncertainty/" href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/reinhart-rogoff-everyone-makes-coding-mistakes-we-need-to-make-it-easy-to-find-them-graphing-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this great one, from Christopher Gandrud</a>, take a look!</p>
<p>On april, the 15th, an <a title="abstract" href="http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> was published that will change economic theories… Or at least, it will questionate and change the methods employed to formule those theories. As a doctor, I spend time on reviewing evidence that can be applied to daily practice. I should right now be reviewing papers, studying or going for a walk, but I came across weird news last week: A paper of <a title="rogoff" href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CM Reinhart and K Rogoff</a>, published in January 2010 defending austerity, was questioned by a student, Thomas Herndon and two of his professors.</p>
<p>Among other statements, Reinhart and Rogoff basically collected <a title="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/data.htm" href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> and <a title="book" href="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that, if a country reached more than 90% of debt respect to its GBP, growth would become abruptly negative. It would be another scientific paper if there weren’t happened two things:</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
<ul>
<li><p>Many politicians, institutions, countries or even the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/17/global-economy-debt-idUSL2N0D404P20130417" target="_blank">European Union</a>, have assumed quickly these facts, without revisiting or trying to reproduce them. This happens all the time, but it <em>shouldn’t</em> happen. It increases the chances that flawed studies reach the status of ‘science’. Sometimes with dramatic consequences.</p></li>
<li><p>A scientific research should be reproducible. It means it should render the same results when repeating the study. But when Herndon tried to replicate it, he found big <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22223190" target="_blank">errors</a> -bad excel coding, data collected selectively- and a dubious weighting method, that when corrected, gave completely different results.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Herndon, Ash and Pollin kindly provided their <a title="http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/" href="http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>, so I rapidly ran it in a R console; I also played with databases from the Reinhart and Rogoff <a title="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/" href="http://www.reinhartandrogoff.com/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>, and from the <a title="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/data.htm" href="http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/data.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maddison-Project</a> database:</p>

<p>It’s a scatterplot with data modelled by a generalized additive model (GAM), and what drawed my attention at first sight was that the correlation between Debt/GDP ratio and growth is <strong>non-linear, and surprisingly <em>weak</em></strong>. Neither debt seems to increase growth nor seems to be heavily associated to recessions -note that I don’t know much of Economics-. ¿What do you think about these data?</p>
