I am about to go on a short holiday, so I was tidying the code lines I had scattered around before leaving... And I found this: a minimal EPS to PDF converter, which is barely a LaTeX template.

It is intended for transforming an .EPS graph to the .PDF format. You can copy & paste this whole code into a blank text file (but with .TEX extension) and run it with a TeX editor. To install and use LaTeX, here it is a [previous post](https://aurora-mareviv.github.io/talesofr/2013/05/learning-latex-from-scratch/){target="_blank"} about it.

When you have compiled it, you can search in the same file's directory for the newly created PDF graph!
