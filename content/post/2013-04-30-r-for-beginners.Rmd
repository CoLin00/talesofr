These days I was remembering my <a title="http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/impatient-r/" href="http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/impatient-r" target="_blank">beginnings</a> as a linux user few years ago, and how I found <a title="http://www.r-project.org./" href="http://www.r-project.org./" target="_blank">R</a> (possibly in a very unlikely way: searching for a SPSS alternative in Linux). For two years, R had been almost impossible for me. I didn't understand its syntax (I don't have programming background), and luckily I had installed <a title="http://www.rcommander.com/" href="http://www.rcommander.com/" target="_blank">R Commander</a> (Rcmdr) to perform simple analysis and plots...

Another feature of Rcmdr (that I didn't use) was that every click to a button remains in a part of Rcmdr's console, and then it can be copied, used and modified. Indeed, the '<em>copypaste</em>' thing has revealed to me as the best way to acquire, recyle, modify and run commands.

Have you installed R? You can try this (nice) code:

- First we store an object called `object` in R's memory (just like a big calculator)

```{r}
object <- seq(1,100,  by=5)
```

- `Object` stores the <a title="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su07/R/html/base/html/seq.html" href="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su07/R/html/base/html/seq.html" target="_blank">sequence </a>(seq) from 1 to 100, by 5. That is: 1,  6, 11, 16, 21 26, 31... If you type <a title="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.html" href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.html" target="_blank">`?seq`</a> in the console, you will have a brief help.

- With R, you can calculate big numbers, logarythms and fractions storing its components, with less chance of errors than with an ordinary calculator.

- You can create new variables from old ones:

```{r}
logobject <- log10(object)
```

- `Logobject` stores the decimal logarythm of every value inside `object`. That is:

```{r}
logobject
```


- You can also plot the variables with simple functions like <a title="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/plot.html" href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/plot.html" target="_blank">`plot`:</a>

```{r}
plot(object)
plot(object, logobject)
plot(object, logobject, col = "red", xlab="My X axis", ylab= "This is my Y axis", main="My first plot")
```


- As you can see, is not very difficult to change the <a title="http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/" href="http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/" target="_blank">color</a> "argument", from "red" to "green" or "blue" for instance. The title, instead of "My first R plot" can be changed to "My coloured R plot", or change the labels of the axes. Don't forget to store these commands and new ones, in a plain Text document, Wordpad etc.. so you can recycle them and fix syntax errors!

- If you feel confident, you can try this. The spoiler is <a title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082429" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082429/plot-a-heart-in-r" target="_blank">here</a>, by DWin

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(t=seq(0, 2*pi, by=0.1) )

xhrt <- function(t) 16*sin(t)^3

yhrt <- function(t) 13*cos(t)-5*cos(2*t)-2*cos(3*t)-cos(4*t)

dat$y = yhrt(dat$t)

dat$x = xhrt(dat$t)

with(dat, plot(x,y, type="l"))

with(dat, polygon(x,y, col="hotpink"))
```
